  "00-01": "We're going to add a ton of new languages to aider via tree-sitter-language-pack.",
  "00-10": "First, lets try and find which languages it supports.",
  "01-00": "Ok, there's a language definitions json file",
  "01-10": "Does it have the github repos for each language?",
  "01-29": "Ok, this is what we need.",
  "01-45": "We need all the tags files from each language's repository. Let's have aider write a script to fetch them all.",
  "02-05": "Let aider read the language definitions json file.",
  "03-37": "Looks like it can't find most of the tags.scm files.",
  "04-19": "Have it try other branches besides master.",
  "05-02": "Ok, it's downloading them now.",
  "05-55": "Let's make it so we can re-run and avoid re-downloading.",
  "06-12": "I see lots of tags files.",
  "06-30": "Ok, restart to run with latest code. This will take awhile to fetch them all.",
  "09-02": "The grep-ast module needs to know about all the new languages.",
  "09-45": "Let's have aider add them all, including their file extensions.",
  "10-15": "Some of the languages need to be recognized by their base name, not extension.",
  "11-15": "Let's sanity check if grep-ast can handle PowerShell now.",
  "12-00": "Looks like it's parsing PowerShell fine.",
  "13-00": "Ok, let's download the tags into the right spot in the aider repo.",
  "14-00": "This will take a minute...",
  "16-07": "Delete some bad or empty tags files.",
  "16-16": "Add the tags to the repo.",
  "16-33": "The tags files need to be modified to work with the repo-map.",
  "17-01": "Let's use bash to script aider to modify each tags file.",
  "17-12": "I'm giving aider a read-only example of working tags file, as an example to follow.",
  "19-04": "Looks like it correctly updated the first couple of tags files.",
  "19-28": "Let's grep to watch how many name tags are left to be updated.",
  "21-30": "This is going to take a little while...",
  "24-39": "Let's add a README file with attribution for these tags files.",
  "27-00": "Ok, all the tags files are updated.",
  "27-10": "Let's add test coverage to be sure these languages work with the repo-map.",
  "27-19": "Dump the fixtures directory structure to a file, to give aider so it knows the layout.",
  "27-50": "Use a bash script to ask aider to add test coverage for each tags file.",
  "28-12": "Let aider read the fixtures directory listing.",
  "28-52": "Just fixing the bash to correctly iterate through the list of tags files.",
  "29-27": "Improve the prompt to make sure aider creates a fixture for each language.",
  "30-25": "Lets run the repo-map tests to see if the new test works.",
  "30-37": "Arduino failed, with an empty repo-map?",
  "31-52": "Can aider figure out what's wrong?",
  "32-42": "Oh! I'm not using the updated grep-ast yet.",
  "32-54": "Ok, now we're parsing Arduino code properly. Undo that bogus test fix.",
  "33-05": "A regression with tsx?",
  "33-20": "Can aider figure out why?",
  "34-10": "Let's check the parsers map.",
  "35-10": "Well, that's all for this recording."
